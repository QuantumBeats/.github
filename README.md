# Welcome to the QuantumBeats team! üôå [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Research%20wiki%20-red?style=plastic&label=Rw&labelColor=blue)](https://github.com/NenadBalaneskovic/NenadBalaneskovic/wiki)

Dear visitors üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,

_QuantumBeats_ is a platform of bot-groups ("teams") aiding research revolving around optimization of algorithms for data analysis and optical hardware-design by utilizing sophisticated mathematical and physical concepts of theoretical (quantum) optics. It consists of the following five bot-teams which are triggered via workflow-dispatched Github-actions on a self-hosted Windows runner and perform specific tasks:  
1. **Research**: Searches in scientific databases such as _Google Scholar_ [<img src="https://github.com/QuantumBeats/.github-private/blob/e0b801b419eaa8943894fc2b2c3523356bb8f5b7/GoogleScholarLogo.PNG" width="50"/>](https://scholar.google.de/) and _arXiv_ [<img src="https://github.com/QuantumBeats/.github-private/blob/3b8cf86aed070a1a252fdbbd3f07b9b8641ca385/arXiv_Logo.PNG" width="50"/>](https://arxiv.org/)
  - for desired and latest articles as well as book titles associated with a specific project of interest and its research topic
  - for most appropriate literature sources and suggests them to the user as a list classified according to the following categories:
    - Mathematics
    - Physics
    - Chemistry
    - Biology
    - Information science
    - Diverse.

2. **Code development**: Stores the latest, tested and debugged versions of software code, as well as useful code snippets and gists. Preferred code languages are (currently)
- ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) & ![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/r-%23276DC3.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=r&logoColor=white) & ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/c%23-%23239120.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white)
- [<img src="https://github.com/QuantumBeats/.github-private/blob/ea6ae05791c9d66caf7c397846513dba18540ac7/Matlab_Logo.png" width="80"/>](https://github.com/QuantumBeats/.github-private/blob/ea6ae05791c9d66caf7c397846513dba18540ac7/Matlab_Logo.PNG) & ![Wolfram Mathematica](https://a11ybadges.com/badge?logo=wolframmathematica)
- ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-%2300f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white) & ![MongoDB](https://a11ybadges.com/badge?logo=mongodb)
- ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white) & ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)
- ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E) & ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)
- ![Scala](https://img.shields.io/badge/scala-%23DC322F.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=scala&logoColor=white) & ![Haskell](https://img.shields.io/badge/Haskell-5e5086?style=for-the-badge&logo=haskell&logoColor=white).

3. **Code tests**: Performs automated nose, pdb and unit tests of pushed software code, including linting.
 
4. **Refactoring**: Performs memory and speed profiling of code execution and generates comprehensive reports containing recommended actions (corrections, improvements, etc.).

5. **Documentation**: Generates automated [<img src="https://github.com/QuantumBeats/.github-private/blob/c67bce28a3fb521629ef46e66a83a20a9e9e67f3/sphinxLogo.PNG" width="80"/>](sphinxLogo.PNG)-documentation of finalized code versions and stores them as ![Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://img.shields.io/badge/Adobe%20Acrobat%20Reader-EC1C24.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Adobe%20Acrobat%20Reader&logoColor=white) & ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) files. In addition, ![LaTeX](https://img.shields.io/badge/latex-%23008080.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=latex&logoColor=white)-generated ![Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://img.shields.io/badge/Adobe%20Acrobat%20Reader-EC1C24.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Adobe%20Acrobat%20Reader&logoColor=white) documentation files are also stored and updated regularly.

## Contribution guidelines üëÄ
Only (human) members of the group selected by the group owner may contribute. There is no official application process. Each group member is assigned to at least one bot-team.  
For further details regarding contribution guidelines and recommendations please refer to the internal QuantumBeats' md-file "_QB membership guidelines_".

## Useful resources üë©‚Äçüíª
Latest research results will be published in the group's dashboard section as ![Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://img.shields.io/badge/Adobe%20Acrobat%20Reader-EC1C24.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Adobe%20Acrobat%20Reader&logoColor=white) reports.  
For further details regarding current research directions please consult these wiki-pages [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Research%20wiki%20-red?style=plastic&label=Rw&labelColor=blue)
